# Socket_Flask_Chat

		
	So this is a Flask app that uses low level python3 code in order to make a TCP chat server. You may use any of the code out of this.(NOT DONE YET)
Requirments, and how to install:
	So all you need is python3, and pip. Then just install Flask with pip, and boom done. Now you can run it. So what you do then is run app.py with python3.(I don't know on windows) Please not this is mostly just a test file for a larger application I am making. This is also my first repository. So sorry for any weird things I say or do.

YOU MAY SAY ANY MEAN THING YOU LIKE. And I thank you for it because WHOOOO free advice.
